Upon applying the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test on the data, a W-statistic of 11.5 was obtained. For n = 10 and at a significance level of 0.05, this  value is greater than the critical value of 8, indicating a statistically significant difference in the useability scores between the two levels.

A more granular analysis of the raw data showed that particularly large contributions to the useability score came from Questions 4, 7, and 10 for both levels. These questions are:
- I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. (4)
- I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. (7)
- I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. (10)

Question 2 also made a fairly large contribution to the SUS for the easy level:
- I found the system unnecessarily complex. (2)

These large contributions indicate that currently the useability (or lack thereof) of the system may be dominated by the lack of instruction and information provided to the player when they start the game. We (the developers) needed to tell them quite a lot of information before they could start, and most of the testers took a few moments to get to grips with the controls. However, the large contribution from Question 7 (I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly) suggests that once they have absorbed and understood how to use the system, they find it easy to use. 

Based on this, we can conclude that there is a satisfactorily significant difference between the different levels of the game. However, considerable gains in useability for both levels could be achieved by implementing methods to provide more information to the user about how to play the game and use the controls at the outset, for example, text explanations and/or tutorials
